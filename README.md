# The-Delivery-Optimization-Problem
The Delivery Optimization Problem is a tool for the traveling salesman problem built using Python with no external libraries. 
It has a hashtable that stores packages with a key-value pair of the package id and package information. 
The algorithm implemented is the Nearest Neighbor which finds the best route for a truck to deliver its packages based 
on a 2-dimensional array of distances between each location.
